Introduction
=============

Repository to hold Javascript algorithm solutions (including Free Code Camp challenges, codewars algorithms, project euler algorithms etc.) and to help keep me accountable and follow my goal of daily algorithm practice.

Detailed descriptions of each algorithm can be found in their files.
## Algorithms:

### Codewars:

1. [longest-palindrome](https://github.com/TomaszGa/javascript-algorithms/blob/master/codewars/longest-palindrome.js)
2. [Product of consecutive Fib numbers](https://github.com/TomaszGa/javascript-algorithms/blob/master/codewars/Product%20of%20consecutive%20Fib%20numbers.js)
